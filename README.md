# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Describtion 

I've decided to join the world of web developing to test myself along with my creative capacity. Apart from this industry being well respected, it also pays well. Ofcourse my pay is based of my skills so me being the ambitious, positive, problem-solver, and inspired person that I am. I know I will achieve my goal of being a web developer and becoming a tech God.
This project of mine that I built was to test my beginner skills and to demonstrate that I indeed can become a web developer. I was informed of bootcamp students like myself, tend to be overwhelmed with the amount of knowledge pushed to us every class day through out the course of 3 months. Therefore I've built and created this web page so that students or anyone can refer to for some key points on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git to help them along their journey. Not only do I help others, I've learned a lot about myself and more on the four basic languages for building a website.
